# OSnake

An original version of the classic Snake game, written in OCaml

## Instructions

Open the OSnake repo in terminal, run `make build`, and then run `make play`. Press `enter` to start, and use the keys `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the snake up, left, down, or right. Eat the apples (red o's) to grow the length of the snake (green []'s), which increases the score. Eat the power apples (pruples O's) before they shrink to gain more points. Avoid the obstacles (blue *'s) and border, or it's Game Over. The speed of the snake increases as the length increases, for an added challenge. Hold down `W`, `A`, `S`, or `D` to make the snake move even faster.

## Please Note

This code was written by Gemma Standley, Fauna Mahootian, and Yunshan Liu as a project for CS 3110 at Cornell University.
